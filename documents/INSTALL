You should use the same settings, as at vacuum build
VACUUM_SDK_PATH - full path to vacuum SDK (for defaults look into qmake/config.inc or cmake/config.cmake)

Unix example
============
qmake VACUUM_SDK_PATH="/usr/include/vacuum" CONFIG-=debug CONFIG-=debug_and_install
make
sudo make install

Windows example
===============
qmake VACUUM_SDK_PATH="c:/vacuum/sdk" CONFIG-=debug CONFIG-=debug_and_install
nmake
nmake install
